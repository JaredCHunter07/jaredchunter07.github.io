            <h1>Hi, I'm Jared Hunter!</h1>
            <p>I happen to be a programmer and an artist (drawing, movie and music producing, etc.). I also suffer from an unidentified, yet high-functioning form of autism. On my free time, I like to surf the internet and look at the dankest memes on the block.</p>
            <p>I am currently taking a summer school course on programming. For one of my projects, I have to do a total of 7 projects in 7 days. This page is the 5th day, and I only did that because I wanted to improve my index page. You're free to look at the pages from my portfolio in the dropdown menu in the top bar.</p>
            <p>I can currently program in HTML5 and CSS3. Sometimes, I program in JavaScript, and jQuery on one time. My first programming language is Visual Basic around the age of 10. I learned that language from YouTube videos when I found out I can actually make a web browser and other Windows programs. Around that time, I started learning ActionScript when making Flash games. At around 2010, I got tired of Visual Basic becuase I want to focus on something else (like surfing the internet). I started programming again at the age of 16 when taking a first-semester computer programming class at Granite Technical Institute. The programming language I was using at the time was C#. I started programming in original C when I was taught how to use an Arduino board in my engineering class. I stopped programming until the age of 17, when I just got done with my senior year, and that I've been approved to take a summer school class. Before I started my class, I had to do a preparation syllabus, involving the C language. After the prep course, I started working on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which is what I'm doing right now.</p>

            <h1>Updates</h1>
            <p><strong>8/2/2016:</strong> Added a tip calculator for <a href="day6.html">Day 6</a>. Also made a <a href="day7/day7.html">Day 7</a> after finishing day 6. Day 7 concludes my "7 webpages in 7 days" project. It is also my final project of my summer programming course. This project will be showcased at the Tech Track (summer school) Graduation on Tuesday, August 9th, 2016 at 7 PM MDT, probably at Olympus High School. The only technical flaw of Day 7 is that you have to wait for the sound to complete in order to play it again, which is kinda slow.</p>
