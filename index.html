        <h1>hai gais hows it going my name is jared hunter</h1>
        <p>ayo lemme introduce maiself. I am autistic (high-functioning, but not defined). I like to surf on the internet and look at some nice memes and shizz. I also like to do stuff, like programming and shizz.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Programmer (2008-present)<p>Visual Basic is my first language. I learned it from YouTube when I found out I can actually make Windows programs that are dank as hell.</p></li>
            <li>Animator (2007-on hiatus)<p>During my time as a producer, I animated my first animations on a pirated copy of Flash MX 2004. I got used to the program, making my movies and Flash games dank af. Over the years, I lost my motivation to animate dank crap (lip syncing, etc.). Recently, I pirated Flash CS6 and animated one thing, but it's not dank, and my copy stopped working.</p></li>
            <li>Movie producer (2006-on hiatus)<p>I produced my first movies in Windows Movie Maker sometime in early-2006 on my mom's computer. I founded my first movie production company in fall 2006 as "quincy67", a made-up potential YouTube channel name. I named it after the Little Einsteins character, Quincy. The 67 is a random number, no representation. The quincy67 channel didn't happen because 1. I didn't know how to make a YouTube account, and 2. The username is already taken. I renamed my company "Jared Hunter Productions" sometime in early 2007, when I started making dank-as-frick YouTube Poops, which I haven't uploaded because I didn't know how to set up my YouTube account. I finally created a YouTube account in late August 2007 under the username "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SPLDjh">SPLDjh</a>", named after another YouTube account which I was a fan of, "Some Pkmn-loving dude", and my initials. I set that account up with a fake e-mail and I have to confirm an e-mail address, so I didn't upload my videos or comment on some videos. I only commented on the profiles' commment section. On April 2008, I finally created my e-mail address, and confirmed my YouTube account. During the summer, I created an alternative account, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/H2OYoshi">H2OYoshi</a>", which would later be my main YouTube account. I learned that there is a trend in alternative accounts. Some YouTube videos I uploaded on my accounts were crappy, so I deleted them. As I'm growing up, I become more interested in things, and I started making movies only for fun, and not for the YouTube accounts. I have a lot of ideas for potential new YouTube videos, but it's complicated to make my videos dank as fuck. I'm leaving this career on hiatus until I feel like making dank crap again.</p></li>
